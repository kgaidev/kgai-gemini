# This script runs at EVERY SessionStart, so two Claude Code windows opened together used

# mkdir is the portable atomic test-and-set that stops that.
#
# A session killed mid-write would otherwise leave the lock behind and block the fix
# forever, so a lock whose owning process is gone is reclaimed. The reclaim must itself be
# race-free: a plain "rmdir the stale one, then mkdir mine" lets two sessions both rmdir
# and both mkdir, and the second deletes the first's fresh lock — the exact duplicate-block
# outcome the lock exists to prevent. So each session writes its own pid into the lock and,
# after any reclaim, re-reads it: only the session whose pid is actually in the dir holds
# it. `find -mmin +1` matches an mtime strictly older than a minute (so up to ~2 minutes in

#     lock, which is the duplicate-block bug through the back door;
#   * an mtime strictly older than a minute (so up to ~2 in practice — a writer holds the
#     lock well under a second) means abandoned;
#   * with no `find` to ask about age, a recorded owner that is provably GONE is enough —

# even an atomic rename) lets a second reclaimer act on the FRESH lock a first reclaimer
# just created, because each judged staleness on the OLD lock but acts on whatever sits
# there now — the reproduced duplicate-block bug. So a separate break-lock serialises the
